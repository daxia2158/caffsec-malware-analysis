This is an experimental MIT App Inventor project which allows you to scan a QR code and send a request for VirusTotal.com to scan the URL.

In order to get this to work, you will need to edit Screen1.blk and replace ENTERAPIKEYHERE with a valid API key from VirusTotal.com


You will need to zip the entire "QRAnalyzer" folder and upload to MIT App Inventor to import this project.
