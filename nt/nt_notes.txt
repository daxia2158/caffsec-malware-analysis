These are "Class A" ip generators



log - a log file from a previous run of the tool (oops, sloppy hacker!)


nt - original ELF executable (not uploaded)

nt_decompiled.c - initial decompiled source of nt, not very helpful

nt_strings.txt - all strings contained in "nt"
Contains identifier  "FTP & NT scanner by Lomax (credits Inode <inode@wayreth.eu.org>)"

pass - a file with a list of passwords

s - an execution script which runs nt pointing it at "pass" and "users".

users - a file with "Administrator" as the only content



Conclusions

"nt" is a remote FTP and NT file share scanner


It is not a virus, but a hack tool.
